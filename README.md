Clients can view available time slots, choose their preferred services (such as braids, weaves, or other hair treatments), and confirm their appointments all in one place. This makes scheduling simple and efficient.

### 2. **User Accounts and Profiles**
With the **Ultimate Member** plugin, clients can create personal accounts to manage their appointments, view their booking history, and update their profile details. This functionality streamlines the user experience and provides a personalized touch for returning clients.
